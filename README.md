HackGT6 - Bean.io

There are two types of people in this world:

1. Those who rush to pick up their coffee and get to work
2. Those who milk that sweet time, enjoying every last second they don't have to be in the office.

This app aims to please both groups.

Using React-Native JavaScript front end and a Google Cloud functions (Python) and ArcGIS REST API, Google Maps API, and Places API, this application will both find your favorite coffee shops on your route while minimizing the additional time added to the trip, AND your favorite coffee shops on the most convoluted, waste-of-time route possible. Users are able to see sorted options with detailed info such as the coffee shop, total trip time, trip time added by the stop (trip time using live traffic data), and the address of the location which is later mapped onto a Google Maps component.

1. git clone repository
2. npm install in project directory
3. open android emulator
4. react-native run-android
5. react-native log-android for log output
