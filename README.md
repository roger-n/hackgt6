HackGT6 - Bean.io

There are two types of people in this world:

1. Those who rush to pick up their coffee and get to work
2. Those who milk that sweet time, enjoying every last second they don't have to be in the office.

This app aims to please both groups.

1. git clone repository
2. npm install in project directory
3. open android emulator
4. react-native run-android
5. react-native log-android for log output

Used boilerplate from https://github.com/victorkvarghese/react-native-boilerplate.
